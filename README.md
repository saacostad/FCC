# FCC TOOLS FOR APJ

In this repository you'll find tools and scripts developed for commisioning of the FCC, specially, related to the implementation of the APJ method for quadrupole corrections. 

## Phase-Beta functions analysis
For the development of the APJ method, some analysis of the lattice functions for the FCC was needed, specially, the behaviour of the phase and beta functions on near-IP quatrupoles. This analysis is found on 'phase_anal.py'.

This code takes the lattice data of FCC and outputs the best quadrupoles to apply corrections in based on their beta-functions values.
